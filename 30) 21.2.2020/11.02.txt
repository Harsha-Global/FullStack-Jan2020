Acetone already the energy on changes method of on changes interface execute automatically when you have received one or more values into input properties that are decorated with a that input decorator and also every time when the input properties of changes from the parent component it will not execute when there are no input properties use the ng-onchange this method if you want to examine the incoming values of input properties and also make some changes in the incoming values who I am removing all the girls in the projects component and also in the product service open the project component and method call NG on changes and confirm information that is ng-onchange is called and as you know already because of NG build--watch and gulp command every time when we modify the code and save the file automatically the energy bill command will recompile and gulp command will copy the files from the dist folder into the www root folder without worrying about the compilation and deployment directly I can be filled application in the browser as you can see the energy on changes method execute three times because the project component in water 3 X 3 projects to identify the values of input properties angular automatically passes a parameter of simple changes type which can be imported from 8 and 9 / ko the simplechanges parameter represents all the properties that I received into input properties really the property one by one in the for loop and foreach property bare print in the current value and previous value the current value is the new value received into the input property and the previous value is the value of the property before receiving the new value now internet is that for every property it has executed the entry on changes once and the parent component that is project component has applied to values one is for the project and other one is for the current value is the actual project object and the previous value is undefined that is the value of the property before receiving the new value increase if required you can make some changes the input properties for example if the project object is received and increasing the value of team size by one not is the actual value of the team size for the project everyone is 14 when I request application now displays 15 instead of 14 and the same velocity execute for all the projects like this in real time projects you can make any changes in the incoming values of the input properties
